To begin utilizing our application, install Node.js on your computer,
go into the node.js cmd prompt, cd into the directory where the zip was unzipped,
npm install, npm run dev, and go to localhost:8080 .

Try to use the application in two browsers, and develop two accounts. The application
requires an "ongoing protest", so develop an organizer account first, and create a protest,
and activate a protest (I've put permissions for all protests for new accounts considering you are the only one utilizing it.). In order to see the consumer-side, use a new browser,
create a citizen account, and then try to join the protest which you activated recently.

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
